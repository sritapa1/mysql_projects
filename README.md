$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5\% * COGS $

Why is VAT added? ---- $VAT$ is added to the $COGS$ and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

Gross Margin----- Gross Margin is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)
